Making a IDataReader wrapper Thread-Safe.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nThe call to the IDataReader Read() Method starts a loaderThread that loads all records into a List.\r\n![Flow](https://raw.github.com/AlienEngineer/ConcurrentReader/master/Doc/b8b4b6f3.png)\r\n\r\nFrom this point on the Read() Method is used to allocate data from the List to the Current Thread. When the current thread tries to read that it will actually get data from a Tuple type.\r\n\r\nThis solution enables the reading process to be as quick as possible making sure the database is released as soon as the data is loaded. Not having to wait for the data computation.\r\n\r\n## Extensions\r\nThe reader can be used in concurrency with other threads any way you wish. Still there are a few extension methods to ease some pain.\r\n\r\n```C#\r\n// Returns some IDataReader implementation...\r\nvar reader = GetReader();\r\n// Wraps the IDataReader with ConcurrentDBReader \r\n// making it Thread-Safe\r\nvar cReader = reader.MakeConcurrent(); \r\n\r\nvar records = 0;\r\n\r\n// The ForEach creates Tasks to execute asynchronously the work\r\nreader.ForEach(r =>\r\n{\r\n    // Independent operation \r\n    Compute(R);\r\n    // Dependent operation therefore the \r\n    // Interlocked.Increment to be synchronized.\r\n    Interlocked.Increment(ref records);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
